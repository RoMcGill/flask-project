        <h3>Mark II</h3>
        
        <p>
            The Mark II Mini was launched at the 1967 British Motor Show,[44] and featured a redesigned grille, a larger
            rear window and numerous cosmetic changes.[39][45][46] A total of 429,000 Mk II Minis were produced.

            A variety of Mini types were made in Pamplona, Spain, by the Authi company from 1968 onwards, mostly under
            the Morris name. In 1969, a fibreglass version of the Mini Mark II was developed for British Leyland's
            Chilean subsidiary (British Leyland Automotores de Chile, S.A., originally the independent assembler EMSSA).
            The bodyshell mould was created by the Peel Engineering Company. Production began in 1970 and continued for
            a few years; these fibreglass Minis can be recognised by the missing body seams and by larger panel gaps.
            The Chilean market was never very large and the hyperinflation and political and social collapse led to the
            1973 coup. The Arica plant was closed in 1974.[47] The reason for the fibreglass body was to enable Leyland
            to meet very strict requirements for local sourcing, increasing to 70.22% in 1971.

        <h3>Mark III</h3>
        <p>
            The Mark III Mini had a modified bodyshell with enough alterations to see the factory code change from ADO15
            to ADO20 (which it shared with the Clubman). The most obvious changes were larger doors with concealed
            hinges. Customer demand led to the sliding windows being replaced with winding windows, although some
            Australian-manufactured Mark I Minis had adopted this feature in 1965 (with opening quarterlight windows).
            The suspension reverted from hydrolastic to rubber cones[48] as a cost-saving measure.[49] (The 1275 GT and
            Clubman retained the hydrolastic system until June 1971, when they, too, switched to the rubber cone
            suspension of the original Minis.[48])

            In 1969, the simple name Mini completely replaced the separate Austin and Morris brands.[50] In April 1974,
            a heater became standard equipment on the entry-level Mini 850, as well, having by then already been
            included in the standard specification of the other models for some time.[48]

            In the late 1970s, Innocenti introduced the Innocenti 90 and 120, Bertone-designed hatchbacks based on the
            Mini platform. Bertone also created a Mini Cooper equivalent, christened the Innocenti De Tomaso, that
            sported a 1275-cc engine similar to the MG Metro engine, but with an 11-stud head, a special inlet manifold,
            and used the "A" clutch instead of the "Verto" type. It also used homokinetic shafts instead of rubber
            couplings.

            The Mini was still popular in the UK, but appeared increasingly outdated in the face of newer and more
            practical rivals. Since the late 1960s, plans had been in place for a newer and more practical supermini to
            replace it, though the Mini was still the only car of this size built by British Leyland for the home
            market.

            <h3>Mark IV</h3>
            
            <p>
                The Mark IV was introduced in 1976, though by this stage British Leyland was working on a new small car
                which was widely expected to replace the Mini before much longer. It had a front rubber-mounted subframe
                with single tower bolts and the rear frame had some larger bushings introduced, all intended to improve
                the car's mechanical refinement and to reduce noise levels. Twin column stalks for indicators and wipers
                were introduced, as were larger foot pedals. From 1977 onwards, the rear light clusters included
                reversing lights.

                In July 1979 the lower end of the Mini range was altered. The basic Mini 850 (which had featured in
                various forms since the original launch 20 years before) was withdrawn. Its place was taken by two
                models at slightly lower and slightly higher price points. The new base model was the Mini City, with
                black-painted bumpers, an untrimmed lower facia rail, part-fabric seats and wing mirror and sun visor
                only on the driver's side, plus unique 'City' body graphics and boot badge. Above the City was the new
                850 SDL (Super Deluxe), which had the same specification as the standard Mini 1000 but with the smaller
                engine.

            <h3>Mark V</h3>
            <p>
                All cars had 8.4-inch (210 mm) brake discs and plastic wheel arches (Mini Special arches), but retained
                the same Mark IV body shell shape. The Mini Cooper was relaunched in 1990, 20 years after the demise of
                the original model. Once again, it featured the long-running 1275-cc engine which had featured on the
                original Mini Cooper, as well as on numerous other BMC/BL/ARG models.

                <p>
                    With the larger Metro being redesigned in 1990 to take the new K-Series engine, the Mini became the
                    sole recipient of the classic A-Series engine with transmission-in-sump layout. The engine mounting
                    points were moved forward to take 1275-cc power units, and includes the later Horizontal Integral
                    Float version of the SU carb, plus the single-point fuel-injected car, which came out in 1991. The
                    998-cc power units were discontinued. An internal bonnet release was fitted from 1992. Production
                    ended in August 1996 as the Mark VII replaced it.

                <p>
                    This was the final version, twin point injection with front-mounted radiator. Full-width dashboard
                    replaces the original shelf, internal bonnet release. Introduction of airbag on driver's side. The
                    basic Mini was the 1.3i, the other model in the range being the Mini Cooper. The end of production
                    in October 2000 not only signalled the end of original Mini production after 41 years, but also
                    brought about the demise of the 1275-cc engine which had powered the Mini and numerous other
                    BL/BMC/ARG cars for more than 35 years. The Metro had ceased production two and a half years
                    earlier, ironically meaning the Mini outlived the car that was supposed to replace it.
